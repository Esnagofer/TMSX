#MSXEMU

MSXEMU is an emulator for the Z80-based MSX computer written in Java. 
I wrote all parts (Z80, VDP, etcetera) from scratch.
This project is undertaken purely for personal recreational purposesâ€”other and much better emulators exist, most notably http://openmsx.org.
That said, I believe the source code of MSXEMU is much simpler and therefore easier to understand than 
  some of the MSX emulators out there.
So, if you're interested in learning how an MSX emulator works, MSXEMU might be of interest.

##The current status

- Almost full MSX1 emulation.
- Runs many Konami ROMs (Antarctic Adventure, Frogger, Konami Tennis, Kings Valley and many more).
- Doesn't yet run all Konami ROMs (Knightmare, Konami Soccer and a couple of others).
- Only support for 16K/32K ROMs. Need to figure out how to map bigger ROMs.
- For the moment no PSG emulation, no music.

This project is work in progress. At the moment, things that need to be done are:

- Fix incompatibilities.
- Add PSG emulation.
- Possibly: MSX2 Emulation and disk emulation.

##How to use

####Building

An ANT build file is included (use target "jar" to create JAR file). If you don't use ANT, you can compile
and create a JAR file as follows. Make sure you're in the root directory (containing the sub-directory `src`). 

```
mkdir build
javac -d build -cp src src/emu/ui/EmuFrame.java
jar cvfe MSXEMU.jar emu/ui/EmuFrame -C build. .
```

Start the JAR file as usual:

```
java -jar MSXEMU.jar
```

####Setting the system ROM

To use the emulator, you need to set the system ROM. You can use either the free C-BIOS (http://cbios.sourceforge.net) or a ROM image of an
actual MSX1 computer. If you use C-BIOS, use the cbios_main_msx1.rom file which is included in the dowload on the C-BIOS website.
ROM images of actual MSX computers can be found at various places on the web. The emulator was developed using a ROM image of a 
Toshiba HX-10 MSX1 computer with international keyboard layout, but ROM images of other MSX1 computers should work too. Upon starting 
the emulator for the first time, only the "Set System ROM" button is enabled. Click it and select the system ROM file that you want to 
use.
